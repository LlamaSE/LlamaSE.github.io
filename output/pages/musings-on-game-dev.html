    <p>Hey all, was pushed by a friend of mine to start a blog to collect and explain my Game Dev process. I am currently working on a tower defense game that I intend to commercially publish down the line. You can go here to find the first article about my process of developing the game or you can check out the categories or tags pages to narrow down what you're looking for. Hopefully my mistakes and frustrations will help you figure out your own processes.</p>
<p>I may also post here from time to time about some of my other interests including travel, gaming, urbanism, socialism and trains.</p>
